## Serrano 
Aiming to offering popular and cutting edge techs in deep learning area on iOS devices, Serrano is developed as a tool for developers & researchers with deep learning background to quickly implement their ideas on iOS devices. Meanwhile, it supports macOS as a pure swift framework bonus. 

## Features
- Implemented an efficient NDArray class [Tensor](http://serrano-lib.org/docs/latest/api/Classes/Tensor.html) which supports:
  - CPU calculation with [BLAS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/blas)/[vecLib](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/veclib)/[vDSP](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/vdsp) for better performance 
  - GPU calculation on [no-copy MTLBuffer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtldevice/1433382-makebuffer) for memory saving
- Offer common operators ([operator list](http://serrano-lib.org/)) for constructing various computation graphs and it is easy to [implement custom operators](http://serrano-lib.org/docs/latest/guides/Extension/Write%20your%20own%20operator/)
- [Graph API](http://serrano-lib.org/docs/latest/api/Classes/ComputationGraph.html) support forward and backward with auto differentiation 
- No third-party library dependent. Compatible with iOS 10 and macOS.

## Install

#### Via CocoaPods
Install the latest version:
```
pod 'Serrano', :git => 'https://github.com/pcpLiu/Serrano.git'
```


#### Manually integrate into your workspace/project

Download or clone Serrano and drag `serrano.xcodeproj` into your workspace or project.
